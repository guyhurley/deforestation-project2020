SAVE OUR RAINFORESTS

RAINFORESTS 
Rainforests cover 6% of the Earth and are home to 50% of the plant and animals species in the world. 
They are known as "the lungs of the earth" as rainforests produce 20% of the world's oxygen and absorb the carbon dioxide.

THE AMAZON RAINFOREST
The Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, covering 5.5 million square kilometres. It's so big that the UK and Ireland would fit into it 17 times! 
The Amazon makes up over half of the earth's rainforests. It was formed 55 million years ago.
10% of the world’s known species live in the Amazon rainforest.
20% of the world’s bird species live in the Amazon rainforest.
It is home to around 2.5 million different insect species as well as over 40,000 plant species.
Around 400-500 indigenous tribes live in the Amazon rainforest. About 50 of the tribes may not have had contact with the outside world.
The canopy of the rainforest is so thick in places that it takes about 10 minutes for the water to reach the ground.

The Amazon rainforest is amazing but more than 1/5 of the Amazon rainforest has already been destroyed. 
The deforestation of the rainforest has had terrible affects for the plants, animals and people living there.
